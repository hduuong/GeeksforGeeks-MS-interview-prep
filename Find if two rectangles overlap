Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.

Note that a rectangle can be represented by two coordinates, top left and bottom right. So mainly we are given following four coordinates.
l1: Top Left coordinate of first rectangle.
r1: Bottom Right coordinate of first rectangle.
l2: Top Left coordinate of second rectangle.
r2: Bottom Right coordinate of second rectangle.

struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
}

public boolean isOverlap(point 1l, point r1, point l2, point r2) {
    if (l1.x > r2.x || l2.x > r1.x) return false;
    if (l1.y < r2.y || l2.y < r1.y) return false;
    return true;
}
