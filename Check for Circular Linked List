Given a singly linked list, find if the linked list is circular or not. A linked list is called circular if it not NULL 
terminated and all nodes are connected in the form of a cycle. Below is an example of circular linked list.

An empty linked list is considered as circular.

Note that this problem is different from cycle detection problem, here all nodes have to be part of cycle.

Approach: traverse tree. if hit null then it is not circular, if hit head again then it is circular.

class Node {
    int value;
    Node next;
    public Node(int v) {
        value = v;
        next = null;
    }
}


public boolean isCircular(Node head) {
    if (head == null) return true;
    
    Node runner = head.next;
    while (runner != null) {
        if (runner == head) return true;
        runner = runner.next;
    }
    return false;
}
